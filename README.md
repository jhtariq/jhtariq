# Hi there, I'm Tariq 👋

Hi! I’m Tariq, a second-year graduate student in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and a member of the **Robotic Caregiving and Human Interaction Lab**. I am actively looking for **full-time robotics roles** in the domains of **perception**, **planning**, and **state estimation**, so feel free to reach out!

- 👨‍💻 **Research:**  
  I am currently advised by **Prof. Zackory Erickson**, focusing on **real-time state estimation of deformable objects (cloth)** for robotic manipulation tasks. My work aims to develop a first-of-its-kind state estimation framework capable of sub-1s detection, improving robotic interaction with deformable materials.  
  I have also contributed to the development of an **assistive knee brace** prototype designed for continuous monitoring of post-surgery knee movements outside clinical settings.

- 🏢 **Industry Experience:**  
  - **Summer 2024:** I interned at **Oshkosh Corporation** as an **Autonomy Intern**, where I developed and deployed a high-accuracy **semantic segmentation model** in a **ROS 2 autonomy stack** on NVIDIA Orin, enhancing AV navigation reliability and reducing dependency on HD maps.  
  - **Previously:** During my undergrad, I interned at **Gamma Technologies**, working on Electric Vehicle modeling, thermal management of batteries, and autonomy development models using **GT-Suite** packages.

- 🎓 **Education:**  
  I graduated with a **B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering** from **NIT Trichy, India**, in 2023. My undergraduate research focused on **prototyping MedTech solutions** and applying **AI techniques** like NLP, Machine Learning, and Image Processing to solve real-world problems.

- 🚀 **Interests:**  
  I am passionate about advancing autonomous systems across diverse environments, with a strong focus on:  
  - **Real-time trajectory optimization**  
  - **Motion planning and control**  
  - **Navigation and Perception**  
  - **Integrating deep learning for enhanced performance and adaptability**

- 🌟 **Looking to Collaborate On:**  
  I am always open to collaborating on projects related to robotics, perception, motion planning, state estimation, and autonomy!
